<h1 align=center>Push Swap</h1>

<p align=center>
  <b>Push Swap</b> is a sorting algorithm project that aims to arrange a stack of numbers in ascending order using two stacks, a limited set of operations and the lowest possible number of actions.
  This challenge tests problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency with complex data structures.
  The goal is to devise an efficient strategy to minimize the number of moves required, optimizing space complexity.

<h3 align="left">What I've learned</h3>

I've acquired a lot of basic knowledge on C programming :
- Problem-solving
- Algorithmic thinking
- Data structures (linked list)
- Optimization
- Attention to detail
- Debugging and troubleshooting
- Testing and validation
- Code readability

---

<h3 align="left">If I had to do it all over again</h3>

- I chose to implement an algorythm based on economy of movement, moving each time the number that requires the fewest movements.
  So I would challenge myself by implementing a new algorythm based on "divide and conquer algorythm" which is more focused on time management.
- I would use free_null instead of free to set pointers to NULL to prevent accidental access to freed memory

---

<h3 align="left">Usage</h3>

- compilation :
```bash
make
```
- execution :
```bash
./push_swap <list of numbers>
```
Numbers can be positive or negative integers.

- return value :

If the arguments are valid, the program will output is a series of instructions or operations that need to be performed on the given stack of numbers in order to sort them in ascending order.
Each instruction represents a specific operation on the stacks, such as swapping two numbers, rotating the stack, or pushing a number from one stack to another.

- Visualizer :

It's possible to see the rendering of movements by using this visualizer : [o-reo visualizer](https://github.com/o-reo/push_swap_visualizer)

<h3 align="left">Rules of the project</h3>

The Push Swap program operates with two stacks: stack A and stack B. Initially, all numbers are placed in stack A, while stack B remains empty.
